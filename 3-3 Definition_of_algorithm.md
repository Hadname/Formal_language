# The Definition of Algorithm
Informal definition:<br> An algorithm is a collection of simple instructions for carrying out some task.

Formal definitions:<br>
+ Using λ-calculus by Alonzo Church in 1936
+ Using Turing machine by Alan Turing in 1936

### Computable Functions
The association between inputs and outputs is called a function.

The process of determining an output of a function from its input is called computing the function

The set of functions that are computable by a computational system is a measure of the computational power of that system.

### Church-Turing thesis
The Church-Turing thesis states taht if an algorithm (a procedure that terminates) exists then there is an equivalent Turing machine or applicable λ-function for that algorithm.

The computational power of Turing machines is as great as any algorithmic system.

圖靈機即現代電腦的數學模型，利用圖靈機可知道一個問題是否可以用電腦解決。

### Implications of Church-Turing Thesis
Computable functions and Turing-computable functions are the same.

Using the set of Turing-computable functions as a test set for comparing the computational powers of various computational system.

If a computational system is capable of computing all the Turing-computable functions, it is considered to be a universal system.

### Hilbert's Problems
In 1900, German Mathematician David Hilbert identified 23 mathematical problems as a challenge for the coming century.

Hilbert's Problems: Devise an algorithm that tests whether a polynomial has an integral root.

In 1970, Yuri Matijasevic showed that no algorithm exists for testing whether a polynomial has integral roots.
